## Overview
This functionality is designed to cancel pending payments created with Easy Credit that have not yet been completed.

<br />

## Conditions

To use this functionality, the customer must have a payment that is created but remains unpaid. For a successful cancellation, the CommerceTools Payment object should meet these criteria:

1. The payment must be an Easy Credit payment.
2. A transaction of type `Authorization` should exist with a state of either `Pending` or `Initial`.
3. The transaction should include an `interactionId`, which is the Easy Credit Payment ID.

## Creating CommerceTools Actions from Easy Credit's Response

When a payment is successfully canceled in Easy Credit, the webhook will update the CommerceTools Payment and Cart with the following actions:

| Action Name (CT)        | Value                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| changeTransactionState   | { "transactionId": "<interactionId>", "state": "Failure" } |
| unfreezeCart            | { "action": "unfreezeCart" }                         |
